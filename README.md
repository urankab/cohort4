## Contents
1. **Getting Started -** First few exercises to understand the basics of Javascript syntax and logic.
2. **Document Object Model -** Playing around with DOM manipulation and HTML/CSS for the first time.
4. **Object Orientated Programming -** Created my first Javascript program (Bank) - Utilized principles of abstraction, encapsulation, inhertiance, polymorphism. Used Jest for unit testing.   
4. **OOP + Fetch, API -** My second Javascript application that allows the user to create, delete and modify city cards. I used fetch API for storing the data.
5. **REACT.js -** Contains a Single Page Application using the React framework. Incorporated the 12 Main Concepts of React in my applications, migrated over my Bank and Cities application, learned to used Hooks, Context, and created apps that showcase data strucuring such as Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues. 
6. **Python -** Pipenv Environment, pytest for unit testing, working with File-IO (reading CVS file, generate report), Excel (OpenPyXL library - read excel sheets and generate invoices), and Flask (continuing off the Excel compentency, I used Flask fetch the data to display on a React front page).

**API (need to run this to test Cities programs)**
Please navigate to the api folder and read README.md for further instructions on starting the API.
